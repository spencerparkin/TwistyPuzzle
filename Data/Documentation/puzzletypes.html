		<h1>6. Puzzle Types</h1>
		<p>
		Documented here are the various types of puzzles supported by the program with a bit of discussion
		accompanying each one of them.  The list proceeds in no particular order.  Note that the
		names I gave to certain puzzle types did not always accurately reflect who invented them.
		Lastly, let me say that I'm not an internet scholar, so forgive me if I've missed some information
		here that a good researcher should have found.
		</p>
		<h2>6.1. Rubik3x3x3</h2>
		This is the classic, well-known 3x3x3 cube invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ern%C5%91_Rubik">Erno Rubik</a> in 1974.
		If you're new to twisty puzzling, this is a good place start.
		<h2>6.2. Rubik2x2x2</h2>
		This is a lower-dimensional equivilant of the 3x3x3, invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_Cube">Larry Nichols</a> in 1970.  This is an even easier place to start than the 3x3x3, and
		the knowledge gained here is directly transferrable to the 3x3x3 if you learn the key-hole method.
		Imagine a 3x3x3 where the edges and centers are invisible and what do you have?  A 2x2x2.
		<h2>6.3. Rubik2x2x3</h2>
		I'm not sure who invented this one.  Interestingly, it is easier than the 2x2x2, and it is certainly
		easier than the 2x3x3.  Methods of solving this are transferable to the Square-1 as it can be
		found as a sub-group of the Square-1.
		<h2>6.4. Rubik2x3x3</h2>
		I believe this one too was invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Domino">Erno Rubik</a>.
		I've used move sequences for this puzzle on the 5x3x3 and the X-cube.
		<h2>6.5. Skewb</h2>
		According to <a href="http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/skewb.htm">Jaap</a>, this one was invented
		by Tony Durham, but the name was coined by Douglas Hofstadter.  Interestingly, only one algorithm
		is needed to solve this puzzle.
		<h2>6.6. SkewbUltimate</h2>
		This puzzle has exactly the same structure as the Skewb; it's just a different shape.
		It was produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewb_Ultimate">Uwe Meffert</a>.
		<h2>6.7. SquareOne</h2>
		This one was invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_One_(puzzle)">Karel Hrsel and Vojtech Kopsky</a>, circa 1990.  This is a great puzzle because of its ability to change shape.  In my estimation, it is about as hard as the 3x3x3.
		<h2>6.8. </h2>
		
		<!--
		6.x Rubiks5x3x3
		If you can solve the 2x3x3 and the 3x3x3, you're practical there, save an understanding
		of the parity issue that can arrise on this puzzle.
