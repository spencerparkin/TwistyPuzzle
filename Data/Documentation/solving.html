		<h1>3. Solving Twisty Puzzles</h1>
		<h2>3.1 Coming up with your own solution</h2>
		<p>
		It is much more satisfying to find your own solution to a puzzle rather than look one up,
		and do not doubt your ability to do so.  Instead, do some research on the concept of
		<b>commutators</b> and <b>conjugates</b>.  Don't give up.  Your solution is only a matter of time.
		</p>
		<h2>3.2 The Program Solve</h2>
		<p>
		As of this writing, the program has a limited ability to solve some of the twisty puzzles.
		The solutions it finds are far from optimal, but they appear to work in all of my testing thus far.
		Note that you won't recognize any concrete solution method being used by the computer as it
		uses the sifting process on a pre-generated stabilizer-chain to come up with its factorizations.
