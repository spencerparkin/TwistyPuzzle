		<h1>3. Solving Twisty Puzzles</h1>
		<h2>3.1 Coming up with your own solution</h2>
		<p>
		In a nutshell, coming up with your own solution amounts to finding enough useful sequences
		that can be used to work your way down through a subgroup chain to the trivial group.
		Of particular interest are sequences in the form of <b>conjugates</b> and <b>commutators</b>.
		Conjugates can often help you create new sequences from old ones.  Commutators let you narrow
		or focus the net impact of a sequence based upon how much or little the two sequences taken in the
		commutator commute with one another.
		</p>
		<h2>3.2 The Program Solve</h2>
		<p>
		As of this writing, the program has a limited ability to solve some of the twisty puzzles.
		The solutions it finds are far from optimal, but they appear to work in all of my testing thus far.
		Note that you won't recognize any concrete solution method being used by the computer as it
		uses the sifting process on a pre-generated stabilizer-chain to come up with its factorizations.

		<h2>3.3 Puzzle Notes</h2>
		<p>
		Here I'm going to keep a bunch of notes that I've collected over the years on solving various
		twisty puzzles.  I encourage the reader to look at these notes only after they've come up with
		their own solution.  It's much more satisfying to solve a puzzle having not resorted to any help,
		even if it takes a very long time, months even, to figure a puzzle out.
		In any case, I do not go into any great detail for most puzzles, perfering instead to document only
		the key concepts and sequences that are easy to forget, leaving the rest to the reader.
