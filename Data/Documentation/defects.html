		<h1>4. Program Defects</h1>
		<p>
		Please report bugs you find in the program, or suggestions for improvement, at <a href="https://github.com/spencerparkin/TwistyPuzzle/issues">https://github.com/spencerparkin/TwistyPuzzle/issues</a>.
		This program was particularly challenging to write, and it's certainly not perfect, but
		it seems to work reasonably well for the most part.  If you find a problem, please let me know.
		My thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to file a bug report.  I can't promise I'll
		be able to address every issue, but I will at least give it some serious thought.
		In reality, I barrowed time I didn't have to write this stupid program.

		<h2>4.1. Known Issues</h2>
		<p>
		Here is a brief list of known issues with the software as of this writing.
		<ul>
			<li>Polygon tessellation doesn't always find a reasonable result.</li>
			<li>The cut-shape capture logic does not always capture all necessary polygons.  This manifests itself as a face that doesn't, though should, turn with the rest of those that do.</li>
			<li>The computer can't yet solve any puzzle.  This is a feature planned for the future.</li>
			<li>Though the user wouldn't notice, there are some memory leaks that need to be addressed.</li>
			<li>Certainly not all possible twisty puzzles can be simulated by the software.  This is a limitation of the algorithms and data-structures used to implement it.</li>
			<li>One flaw in the design of this software is its being prone to accumulated round-off error.  The problem has been solved and mitigated to some extent, but the notion lingers in the code.</li>
		</ul>
