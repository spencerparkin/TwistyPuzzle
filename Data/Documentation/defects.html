		<h1>4. Program Defects</h1>
		<p>
		Please report bugs you find in this program, or give suggestions for improvement, at <a href="https://github.com/spencerparkin/TwistyPuzzle/issues">https://github.com/spencerparkin/TwistyPuzzle/issues</a>.
		This program was particularly challenging to write, and it's certainly not perfect, but
		it seems to work reasonably well for the most part.  If you find a problem, please let me know.
		My thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to file a bug report.  I can't promise I'll
		be able to address every issue, but I do promise to give it some serious thought.
		In reality, I barrowed time I didn't have to write this infernal program.

		<h2>4.1. Known Issues</h2>
		<p>
		Here is a not-so-brief list of known issues with the software as of this writing.
		</p>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>There are some anti-aliasing issues with some of the border rendering.</li>
			<li>Extraneous faces can be generated by either lack of sufficient precision, or poorly calculated vertices or cut-shape locations.</li>
			<li>The computer can't yet solve any puzzle.  This is a feature planned for the future, if I ever get around to it.  Instead of writing specialized code for each individual puzzle, (which would be an insane amount of work), I'm hoping to encode each puzzle state into a data-structure representative of the associated permutation group, then run some group theory algorithms on it.  This may be too lofty a goal, but I like to kick this can around in my mind from time to time.</li>
			<li>Though the user wouldn't notice, there are some memory leaks that need to be addressed.  Some are out of my control as they are happening in 3rd-party library code.</li>
			<li>Certainly not all possible twisty puzzles can be simulated by the software.  This is a limitation of the algorithms and data-structures used to implement it.  Still, it is a generalization I'm quite happy with as it can simulate quite a large class of puzzles, and a few outside that class with some special-case code.</li>
			<li>One possible flaw in the design of this software is its being susceptable to accumulated round-off error.  In all cases of which I'm currently aware, this doesn't seem to come up as a problem.</li>
			<li>Dynamic axis-label assignment does not always assigne unique labeling.  When it does, however, you can be reasonably sure that the puzzle is in a conventional orientation, ready to accept a rotation sequence from the command-line interface.</li>
			<li>I'm not sure if the click-on-face-and-drag mode of manipulating the puzzle will ever work as nicely as I would like in all puzzle cases.  It has the potential to be the most convenient and intuitive way of manipulating the puzzle.</li>
			<li>Command-sequence interface-mode can't yet do the jumbling moves or other special moves supported by some puzzles.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		And I'm sure there are yet more issues; but other than all that, I feel I can put the program to rest for the time
		being until I become obsessed with it again.
