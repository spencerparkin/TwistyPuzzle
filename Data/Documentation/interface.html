		<h1>2. Interfacing with the Puzzle</h1>
		<p>
		Upon program instantiation, you are immediately presented with a standard 3x3x3
		Rubik's cube.  It is not immediately obvious, because no cuts are visible on the
		cube, but if you click on the "Puzzle" menu, you'll see that the "Rubiks3x3x3" menu
		item is checked.  You can use this menu to create other puzzle types.
		</p>
		<p>
		The sub-sections that follow are worth reading, but if you'd like to watch a video
		introduction to the program, I tried to make one at <a href="https://youtu.be/OVWdLHdGs2M">"https://youtu.be/OVWdLHdGs2M"</a>.  If this link
		fails, it may be that you need to install "snapd-xdg-open".  Note that I failed to
		capture the mouse cursor in this video, but it should still be fairly instructive.
		</p>
		<p>
		In general, the often-combersome nature of manipulating a virtual twisty puzzle can make
		them much less fun to play with than their physical counter-parts.  The intuitiveness
		and ease-of-use of the user-interface to such a puzzle, therefore, is of paramount importance;
		and that is why a number of ways of manipulating the puzzle have been provided as
		discussed in the following sub-sections.  Dispite these difficulties, however, there are a
		number of obvious advantages to a computer simulation as I hope you'll see.
		</p>
		<h2>2.1. Orienting the Puzzle</h2>
		<p>
		Holding down the left mouse button with the cursor inside the window's drawing area
		while dragging the mouse, you'll see that the puzzle can be rotated so as to give you
		a view of the puzzle from almost any perspective.  While holding down the shift key,
		rotating the mouse wheel lets you zoom in and out.
		</p>
		<h2>2.2. Rotating Sections of the Puzzle</h2>
		<p>
		There are two ways to do this using the mouse, and a third way using the keyboard.
		</p>
		<h3>2.2.1. Rotate by Cut-Shape</h3>
		<p>
		By now you've probably noticed a few semi-transparent arrows poking out of the puzzle.
		These represent axes of rotation about which a cut-shape cuts-out and rotates a portion
		of the puzzle.  After right-clicking on the arrow-tip of one of these axes, you'll see
		the cut-shape appear and the arrow draw a bit brighter.
		You can then use the mouse wheel to rotate the portion of the puzzle
		intersected by the selected cut-shape.
		</p>
		<p>
		Manually selecting the cut-shape axis like this can be annoying; so in that case, you may
		find it more convenient to turn on auto-selection of these axes.  To do that, use the
		"Auto Select Axes" menu item under the "Interface" menu.  This causes the cut-shape axis nearest
		the mouse-ray to be selected at all times.  Admittedly, this is an idea stolen
		from the well-known gelatin-brain program.
		</p>
		<h3>2.2.2. Rotate by Grip</h3>
		<p>
		This means of manipulating the puzzle was harder to implement and, consequently, a bit less reliable,
		but it is far more intuitive and less tedious than the previous method.  As of this writing, it
		is best to generate all cuts of the puzzle before using this method, which is often the case after
		a good scrambling.  Go to the "Program" menu and select "Scramble".  After dismissing the subsequent
		dialog, wait for the puzzle to scramble, then move your mouse cursor over a face of the puzzle.
		Now, while holding down the right mouse button, drag the mouse to see how the puzzle is manipulated.
		With practice, you can get a feel for how this works.  Be sure to drag the mouse cursor
		in a straight line for best results.  If at all possible, click on a face of the puzzle that can only
		be affected by the desired rotation axis.  I've noticed that with puzzle with many axes, it's just too
		hard to use this manipulation method.  Furthermore, if a puzzle has overlapping, parallel rotation axes,
		I do not as yet have a way of determing which one is the intended axes of rotation.
		</p>
		<h3>2.2.3. Rotate by Sequence</h3>
		<p>
		Go to the "Render" menu and select "Draw Axis Labels" if it is not already checked.
		Axis labels should then appear
		next to each of the arrows poking out of the puzzle.  There are two types of such labels:
		those that are assigned dynamically, and those that are statically assigned.  If in the
		former case, the labels will changes as you orient the puzzle; otherwise, they always stay
		the same.  For some puzzles, this dynamic labeling is convenient, for others, it isn't.
		</p>
		<p>
		Now click in the text-control at the bottom of the window, above the status bar.
		Here you can enter a comma-delimited sequence of rotation commands, each of which
		being simply the name of an axis of the puzzle with an "i" optionally appended.
		For example, on the Rubik's Cube, you might enter "U,R,Ui,Li,U,Ri,Ui,L" without the quotes.  Entering this sequence should enqueue 8 rotations as shown in the status bar.  For puzzles with a special move, such
		as the CurveyCopter3, you can prepend an exclamation mark, or caret symbol to access the
		special move, and its alternate.
		</p>
		<h3>2.2.4. Special Cases</h3>
		<p>
		Some puzzles have special moves that other puzzles do not.  As of this writing, the Curvy Copter
		and Curvy Copter 3 are
		the only examples.  To jumble an edge of the Curvy Copter, select its rotation axis, then rotate
		with the mouse wheel as usual, but while holding the ALT or ALT+SHIFT keys down.  The same goes for the Curvy Copter 3.
		</p>
		<h2>2.3. Undo/Redo</h2>
		<p>
		If you make a mistake, you can always use the "Go Backward" menu option under the
		"History" menu.  Note that as of this writing, your rotation history does not presist
		with the saving of your puzzle to disk.
		</p>
		<h2>2.4. Face Colors</h2>
		<p>
		If you so desire, you can change the color of the faces of a puzzle by right-double-clicking on a face to bring up the color-choose dialog.  Note that you can do this with any face, even after the puzzle has been scrambled.  So if you want the keep the puzzle sane, choose your colors before you scramble the puzzle.
		</p>
		<h2>2.5. Working With Snapshots</h2>
		<p>
		There is an experimental feature designed to aide the user in his or her analysis of
		a move sequence.  Working with a well-scrambled puzzle, choose the "Take Snap-shot" menu
		item from the "Interface" menu.  Having taken a snap-shot of the puzzle, execute a rotation
		sequence in any way you'd like (e.g., use the command-line interface to quickly try a sequence
		you're working on.)  Once the sequence is complete, choose the "Draw Diff" option from the "Render"
		menu to draw splines from a face's old location to its new location, if it moved at all.
		An example is illustrated in the
		following screen shot.
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><img src="CurvyCopter3TriCycle.png"/></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		Here is shown a tri-cycle that can be found on the CurvyCopter3 puzzle.  The color of a spline indicates
		the color of the face that imaginatively moved along that spline to end up in its current location.
