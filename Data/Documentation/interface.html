		<h1>2. Interfacing with the Puzzle</h1>
		<p>
		Upon program instantiation, you are immediately presented with a standard 3x3x3
		Rubik's cube.  It is not immediately obvious, because no cuts are visible on the
		cube, but if you click on the "Puzzle" menu, you'll see that the "Rubiks3x3x3" menu
		item is checked.  You can use this menu to create other puzzle types.
		</p>
		<p>
		In general, the often combersome nature of manipulating a virtual twisty puzzle can make
		them much less fun to play with than their physical counter-parts.  The intuitiveness
		and ease of the user-interface to such a puzzle, therefore, is of paramount importance;
		and that is why a number of ways of manipulating the puzzle have been provided as
		discussed in the following sub-sections.  Dispite these difficulties, however, there are a
		number of obvious advantages to a computer simulation as I hope you'll see.
		</p>
		<h2>2.1. Orienting the Puzzle</h2>
		<p>
		Holding down the left mouse button with the cursor inside the window's drawing area
		while dragging the mouse, you'll see that the puzzle can be rotated so as to give you
		a view of the puzzle from different perspectives.  As of this writing, it is the only
		way of viewing the puzzle, but with practice, it is not hard to quickly orient the puzzle
		into the desired view.
		</p>
		<h2>2.2. Rotating Sections of the Puzzle</h2>
		<p>
		There are two ways to do this using the mouse, and a third way using the keyboard.
		</p>
		<h3>2.2.1. Rotate by Cut-Shape</h3>
		<p>
		By now you've probably noticed a few semi-transparent arrows poking out of the puzzle.
		These represent axes of rotation about which a cut-shape cuts-out and rotates a portion
		of the puzzle.  After right-clicking on the arrow-tip of one of these axes, you'll see
		the cut-shape appear.  You can then use the mouse wheel to rotate the portion of the puzzle
		intersected by the cut-shape.
		</p>
		<h3>2.2.2. Rotate by Grip</h3>
		<p>
		This means of manipulating the puzzle was harder to implement and, consequently, a bit less reliable,
		but it is far more intuitive and less tedious than the previous method.  As of this writing, it
		is best to generate all cuts of the puzzle before using this method, which is often the case after
		a good scrambling.  Go to the "Program" menu and select "Scramble".  After dismissing the subsequent
		dialog, wait for the puzzle to scramble, then move your mouse cursor over a face of the puzzle.
		Now, while holding down the right-mouse button, drag the mouse to see how the puzzle is manipulated.
		</p>
		<h3>2.2.3. Rotate by Sequence</h3>
		<p>
		Coming soon.
		</p>
		<h3>2.2.4. Special Cases</h3>
		<p>
		Some puzzles have special moves that other puzzles do not.  As of this writing, the Curvy Copter
		is the only example.  To jumble an edge of the Curvy Copter, select its rotation axis, then rotate
		with the mouse wheel as usual, but while holding the ALT or ALT+SHIFT keys down.
