		<h1>5. Solving Strategies</h1>
		<p>
		It is worth the effort to resist the temptation to look-up a solution to a given
		twisty puzzle and instead seek a solution of your own.  Do not doubt your ability
		to do so.  In a nut-shell, finding your own solution to a twisty puzzle amounts
		to a combination of discovery and invention of enough useful rotation sequences that,
		taken together, provide all the necessary tools to get the puzzle solved.
		In general, such sequences can be divided into two categories: those that orient,
		and those that premute.  Some sequences require discovery through expiramentation
		and analysis.  Make up what may be a useful move sequence, then record the state
		of the puzzle on paper before and after you execute that sequence.  How did the
		puzzle change?  How did the puzzle stay the same?  How can you combine this sequence
		with others that you've cateloged to invent an even more useful sequence?

		<h2>5.x Group Theory</h2>
		<p>
		This section is not for everyone, so you may want to skip it; and I'm far from an expert
		on group theory, but no discussion
		of twisty puzzle solution stratagy is complete, in my opinion, without at least mentioning
		the beautiful subject of group theory.  In most cases it is easy to see a given twisty
		puzzle may be modeled by the most fundamental of all mathematical structures: the group;
		specifically, a permutation group.  (In fact, it has been shown that every finite group is
		isomorphic to a group of permutation.)
		</p>
		<p>So what is it?  In short, a group is a set of elements
		closed under an operation for which there exists exactly one element of the group with the
		property of being an identity, and where all elements of the group have an inverse with
		respect to the said operation.  You are already familiar with many examples in your mathematical
		travels: the integers under addition, all non-singular matrices under matrix multiplication,
		the symmetries of a regular N-gon.  So why do we care?  Well, the set of all mappings from
		the solved state of a given twisty puzzle to its current state, under the operation of function
		composition, forms yet another well-known example of a group!  All of group theory, therefore,
		can be brought to bare on the study of twisty puzzles.
		</p>
		<p>
		So what are these mappings?  Think of them as what you would do to peal all the stickers off
		the puzzle and place them in new or same locations.  Of course, in practice you'd never want to do that,
		but, in many cases, you can effectively do the same thing through a sequence of rotations
		provided by the puzzle.
		These are the base mappings that generate the entire permutation group modeling the puzzle.  In
		other words, every way you can legally re-arrange the stickers may be found as a composition of these
		mappings.
		</p>
		<p>
		We're now ready to state the problem of solving a twisty puzzle in terms of group theory as follows.
		Given a random element taken from a group generated by a finite set of elements, find the inverse
		of that element in terms of the generators.  This doesn't sound very helpful, but hopefully what may
		be so is to be found in the following sub-sections.
		</p>
		<h3>5.x.1. Conjugates and Commutators</h3>
		<p>
		Explain commutators through example.  Explain conjugates as setup moves in cubist parlance.
		</p>
		<h3>5.x.2. Recognizing Subgroups</h3>
		<p>
		A common tactic in all of problem solving is to take a problem and break it down into more
		managable sub-problems.  This happens naturally with twisty puzzles in the form recognizing
		sub-groups of the group that models the puzzle.  In fact, you'll often be working within
		a coset of the sub-group which, when made a group under an obvious choice of operator, is
		isomorphic to that sub-group.  This often takes the form as imagining all but a select sub-set
		of faces of the puzzle to be visible until you have those visible faces in the desired locations.
		</p>
		<h3>5.x.3. Working Through Nested Subgroups</h3>
		<h3>5.x.4. The Parity Problem.</h3>
		<p>
		A parity problem usually manifests itself in the form of two faces needing transposition,
		which cannot seem to be done using any obvious move sequence.  One way to think about what's
		going on here is that you may be working inside a coset that is not a sub-group.  Not being
		a group, the coset has no identity element, and that's why you're stuck.  What you have to
		do is find a move sequences, any, that takes you out of the coset and into the sub-group.
		</p>
		<p>
		To be somewhat more specific, consider a layer of some twisty puzzle that is in a state where
		it can't be solved using tri-cycles (sequences that permute exactly 3 faces), because a face
		swap is needed.  If you can't find a move that does a single swap, can you find a move that does
		an odd number of swaps?  Every tri-cycle is actually an even number of swaps.  So if you can
		pull off any odd number of swaps, you can then move on to solve your layer with tri-cycles as usual.
		Your odd-swap move may take the form of a large N-cycle, where N is even.
