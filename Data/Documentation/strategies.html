		<h1>5. Solving Strategies</h1>
		<p>
		It is worth the effort to resist the temptation to look-up a solution to a given
		twisty puzzle and instead seek a solution of your own.  Do not doubt your ability
		to do so.  In a nut-shell, finding your own solution to a twisty puzzle amounts
		to a combination of discovery and invention of enough useful rotation sequences that,
		taken together, provide all the necessary tools you'll need to get the puzzle solved.
		In general, such sequences can be divided into two categories: those that orient,
		and those that premute.  (Or you can think of them all as permutors.)
		Some sequences require discovery through expiramentation
		and analysis.  Make up what may be a useful move sequence, then record the state
		of the puzzle on paper before and after you execute that sequence.  How did the
		puzzle change?  How did the puzzle stay the same?  How can you combine this sequence
		with others that you've cateloged to invent an even more useful sequence?
		Can you algebraically compress or otherwise simplify your new sequence?

		<h2>5.1 Group Theory</h2>
		<p>
		This section is not for everyone, so you may want to skip it; and I'm far from an expert
		on group theory, but no discussion
		of twisty puzzle solution stratagy is complete, in my opinion, without at least mentioning
		the beautiful subject of group theory.  In most cases it is easy to see how a given twisty
		puzzle may be modeled by the most fundamental of all mathematical structures: the group;
		specifically, a permutation group.  (In fact, it has been shown that every finite group is
		isomorphic to a group of permutations.)
		</p>
		<p>So what is a group?  In short, a group is a set of elements
		closed under an operation for which there exists exactly one element of the group with the
		property of being an identity, and where all elements of the group have an inverse with
		respect to the said operation.  You are already familiar with many examples in your mathematical
		travels: the integers under addition, all non-singular matrices under matrix multiplication,
		the symmetries of a regular N-gon.  So why do we care?  Well, the set of all mappings from
		the solved state of a given twisty puzzle to any given state of that puzzle, under the operation of function
		composition, forms yet another well-known example of a group!  All of group theory, therefore,
		can be brought to bare on the study of twisty puzzles.
		</p>
		<p>
		So what are these mappings?  Think of them as what you would do to peal all the stickers off
		the puzzle and place them in new or same locations.  Of course, in practice you'd never want to do that,
		but, in many cases, you can effectively do the same thing through a sequence of rotations
		provided by the puzzle's design.
		These are the base mappings that generate the entire permutation group modeling the puzzle.  In
		other words, every way you can legally re-arrange the stickers may be found as a composition of these base
		mappings.  Note that not every re-arrangement of the stickers is necessarily reachable through a
		composition of the base mappings.  (If you've ever taken a 3x3x3 apart and put it back together
		wrong, you'll know exactly what I mean.)
		</p>
		<p>
		We're now ready to state the problem of solving a twisty puzzle in terms of group theory as follows.
		Given a random element taken from a group generated by a finite set of elements, find the inverse
		of that element in terms of the generators.  This doesn't sound very helpful, but it is indeed the
		premise of all twisty puzzles, and it's a place to start.
		</p>
		<h3>5.1.1. Conjugates and Commutators</h3>
		<p>
		So often is it the case that a useful rotation sequence contains
		a certain algebraic pattern that we must give it a name.  Two such names that
		have arisen are "conjugate" and "commutator."  We begin with a treatment of the latter,
		and then return to the former.
		</p>
		<p>
		The following diagram illustrates one possible application of a commutator.  The net effect
		of a commutator may be desirable in a number of unforseable ways, but the following example
		will show one way to put commutators to work for us under a certain, yet somewhat general
		circumstance.  In the diagram below,
		each row of slots and their content illustrate the puzzle state, and the mappings "X" and "Y" and their inverses
		are being used to take us from one state to another.  Notice that a dotted line partitions the
		puzzle state into two parts.
		<center><img src="CommutatorDiagram.png"/></center>
		Suppose one day you find a useful rotation sequences (call it "X") that, as shown in the diagram
		above, transposes the contents of slots A and B, leaves everything else invariant on the
		left side of the dotted line, but effectively scrambles everything to the right of the dotted line.
		We need not despare at the said scrambling, for we may also know of another rotation sequence
		(call it "Y") that simply transposes the two pairs of slots (A,B) with (C,D), leaving everyting
		else invarient on both sides of the dotted line.  Now consider the result of the commutator
		"X,Y,Xi,Yi" as shown above.  Indeed, we have just found a way to do two flips simultaneously of two different
		slot pairs.  Notice that the commutator leaves everything right of the dotted line untouched,
		though this indeed is where some scrambling did occur temprorarily during execution of the commutator.
		</p>
		<p>
		Another way to think about commutators is as a way of minimizing collateral impact on the puzzle.
		Commutators are a measure of how well two elements (permutations) X and Y commute.  If they fully
		commute, then the commutator has no effect on the puzzle.  If they commute a little bit, the effect they'll
		have on the puzzle can be focused on an isolated region.  If they don't commute very much at all,
		then their commutator will have a higher net impact on the state puzzle.
		</p>
		<p>
		Returning now to conjugates, these too may have a desirable effect in unforseable ways.
		A common and useful way, however, would
		be in the form of what are referred to as "setup moves" in cubist parlance.  The idea
		is simple.  If you know a useful rotation sequence, but it does not appear immediately
		applicable in your current situation, start with a rotation sequence that sets you up
		to do the useful sequence, do the useful sequence, then unwind the setup sequence.
		This is a classic example in problem solving of tackling a problem by turning it into a different,
		yet similar problem that you do know how to solve.
		</p>
		<p>
		To illustrate the concept of conjugates, let's look at an example.  Suppose you know a move
		sequence (call it "Y") that tri-cycles the contents of 3 slots.  Well, if we know of another move
		sequence (call it "X") that transposes one of those slots with some other slot, we can create
		a new tri-cycle move sequences that tri-cycles the contents of 3 different slots.  This is
		done by conjugating one move sequence with the other as illustrated in the diagram below.
		<center><img src="ConjugateDiagram.png"/></center>
		Which tree slots are tri-cycled with the conjugate "X,Y,Xi" that we just created?
		(Look at the initial state of the puzzle and compare it to the final state.)
		</p>
		<h3>5.1.2. Recognizing Subgroups</h3>
		<p>
		A common tactic in all of problem solving is to take a problem and break it down into more
		managable sub-problems.  This happens naturally with twisty puzzles in the form of recognizing
		sub-groups of the group that models the puzzle.  In fact, you'll often be working within
		a coset of the sub-group which, when made a group under an obvious choice of operator, is
		isomorphic to that sub-group.  This often takes the form of imagining all but a select sub-set
		of faces of the puzzle to be visible until you have those visible faces in the desired locations.
		</p>
		<h3>5.1.3. Working Through Nested Subgroups</h3>
		<p>
		I can't speek too much to this idea except to say that it is one of the important insights
		had by those who have made break-throughs with twisty puzzles by using group theory.
		(See <a href="http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/thistle.htm">Thistlethwaite's Algorithm</a>.)
		</p>
		<p>
		In short, as you get closer to solving a twisty puzzle, you're trying to restrict yourself
		to move sequences that preserve more and more of the puzzle.  In fact, what you're doing is working in
		smaller and smaller subgroups of the puzzle's group.  Specifically, at a given stage of your
		solve, you're working in a subgroup that can be described as a stabalizer of all the faces
		you have already solved in previous stages.  Try to classify all the move sequences you discover
		and invent in terms of what they stabalize.  Move sequences that fall under the same class can be
		used at the same stage of your solve.
		</p>
		<h3>5.1.4. The Parity Problem.</h3>
		<p>
		A parity problem usually manifests itself in the form of two faces needing transposition,
		which cannot seem to be done using any obvious move sequence.  One way to think about what's
		going on here is that you may be working inside a coset that is not a sub-group.  Not being
		a group, the coset has no identity element, and that's why you're stuck.  What you have to
		do is find a move sequence, any, that takes you out of the coset and into the sub-group.
		</p>
		<p>
		It may also be possible to define the parity problem in terms of the parity of a given permutation.  By definition, this is the parity (even or odd) of a number N, where N
		is the number of disjoint cycles you may find
		that, taken together, make up the permutation.  Couchy proved that
		this parity is consistent across all ways a given permutation can be written as a
		composition of transpositions.  The parity problem can now be thought of as a situation
		where an odd permutation is needed, but only even permutations appear to
		be at your disposal.  (Note that the subset of all even permutations forms a subgroup, but not the subset of all odd permutations.)  A solution to the parity problem is then simply any odd permutation.  In many cases it ends up being a permutation that messes the puzzle up quite a bit, but if you begin again with the rest of the move sequences
		in your repertoire, you eventually reach the solved state without encountering the parity.
