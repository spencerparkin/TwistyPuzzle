		<h1>Katsuhiko Okamoto's Latch Cube</h1>
		<p>
		I've had this puzzle for several weeks now and I've only been able to solve it twice!
		It's difficulty and need for being very methodical at every step, make it a great puzzle!
		</p>
		<p>
		I have a strategy that works with some effort, but it requires some trial and error, and
		so I must confess that there is probably much I still don't see in the puzzle.  I can
		get it solved with enough effort, though, but not without feeling like I have to grope through
		the dark and bump into a few dead-ends before finally reaching the objective.
		In contrast, when solving the regular Rubik's Cube, you always know, from any given
		state, how to get it into a new state that is closer to the solved state.  With the
		Latch Cube, some sequences can't always be applied in full, and you cannot always
		detect this before trying the sequence, so sometimes you have to abort (i.e., back
		the partial sequence out.)  Also, while I'm not sure if it is always necessary, sometimes
		only lateral moves can be made in the sense that, from the Rubik's Cube perspective,
		you're not getting the cube closer to the solved state, but possibly doing a move
		that's needed to get you into a position where you finally can move it closer.
		</p>
		<p>
		So here's my strategy...
		</p>
		<h2>Step 1: Ignore the corners, and solve the edges first.</h2>
		<p>
		With some intuitive moves, you can get something like the white cross, but for the
		most part, stick with the simplest kind of edge permutation sequence: a commutator
		of two adjacent faces.  This tri-cycles 3 edges that surround a corner, or that
		form a line between 2 corners.  You can prevent a need to abort the sequence by
		first checking that both involved faces are unlocked (can turn), and that the arrows, if any,
		on the sides of the edges that are not on one of the two involved faces agree with the unlocked direction
		of the appropriate one of those two faces it will land on during the course of the sequence.
		That's a mouth-full, but with practice, identifying when the full commutator will go entirely through or not
		becomes an easy and routine check.  Interestingly, even if the commutator goes through once, it will
		not necessarily go through a second time, but this is less likely if all edges are
		already solved in terms of position and orientation.  (That is, after this first step,
		it is more likely that any commutator can be repeated indefinitely, if it can be done at all.)
		</p>
		<p>
		While positioning edges, try to get them oriented correctly at the same time.
		For the said commutator, memorize what orientation the edge cubies land in as they
		permute.  This will help you to get them to land in the correct position and orientation.
		</p>
		<p>
		The end-game of solving the edges is the crux of the entire puzzle, in my opinion.  You can
		sometimes get everything positioned properly, but then have an even number of edges
		misoriented.  Looking at a corner of the cube, and labeling the faces X,Y,Z as you
		would a standard right-handed system, I found the following sequence helpful.
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>Q = Xi,Z,X,Zi,rot(2pi/3),Z,Xi,Zi,X,rot(-2pi/3)</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		Here, <code>rot(...)</code> means to rotate the entire puzzle on the axis of the corner
		you're looking at by the given angle in radians.
		Following convention, X is a clock-wise rotation while Xi is counter-clockwise, as
		can be said for Y and Z.  Of course, replace Xi with 3X, if needed, or X with 3Xi.
		To keep yourself from getting confused about the need to do this replacement, memorize
		which cubie needs to move and where-to during the execution of the commutator instead of
		memorizing which face needs to move and in which direction during the execution.
		</p>
		<p>
		The net effect of the sequence Q, (if it will go through), is to simply flip the
		two edges on the north side of the X and Z faces.
		</p>
		<p>
		Note that setup moves can be used to get this step done in the way that such moves
		are traditionally useful in solving the regular 3x3x3; however, on the Latch Cube, they
		can also be used to temporarily unlock a needed face.  I have found this to be extremely
		useful on many occations.  Keep this in your bag of tricks for Steps 2 and 3 also.
		</p>
		<p>
		I've also observed that sometimes you can use a setup move mid-sequence.  That is, if
		you start a sequence that can't be finished, you may still be able to finish it by
		performing a setup move that unlocks the blocked face, finish the sequence (or a certain
		part of it), then undo the setup move.  Sometimes, some elaborate combination of setup moves can be
		interwoven with your sequence, but you have to be careful to remember them well so
		that you can undo them in the right order and in the appropriate places.
		</p>
		<h2>Step 2: Position the corners.</h2>
		<p>
		If R denotes any commutator between 2 adjacent faces, then 3R will preserve Step 1
		while permuting corners; specifically, it performs a pair of corner swaps.  With some
		trial and error, and setup moves, I believe you can always get all the corners positioned this way.
		</p>
		<h2>Step 3: Orient the corners.</h2>
		<p>
		Finally, to orient the corners, I found 2Q to be a helpful sequence.  This will do
		two pairs of edge twisting, rotating 4 corners total.  The end-game, however, will
		sometimes come down to a need to twist just two corners.  To do this, take 2R in
		an appropriate commutator of a single face as is conventional to rotate just 2 corners
		of the regular 3x3x3.  Sometimes, however, you're blocked by locked faces, and must
		finish the sequence by rotating an unintended corner.  Eventually, however, you should
		be able to get that last pair of corners done.
		</p>
		<h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>
		<p>
		Such a great puzzle!  I really thought I would never get it solved, but I perservered
		and refused to look at any help.  The more time I spent with the puzzle, the more tricks
		I seemed to find to get things where and how I wanted them.
		</p>
		<p>
		There are some obvious variations that could be made on the idea of this puzzle.
		For example, we could put arrows on some of the corner cubie faces instead of the
		edge cubie faces.  In that case, solving corners first would probably be the best
		strategy.  And then dare I say, we might put arrows on some edges and some corners!
		</p>
		<p>
		There are other bandaging puzzles (e.g., just put tape on a regular 3x3x3), but the
		bandaging on the Latch Cube has a much more complicated quality to it that I can't quite
		put my finger on.  In any case, it falls under a category of puzzles that can't be
		modeled in group theory using a permutation group.  Instead, something called a groupoid
		must be used, I believe.  Solving the group factorization problem is straight-forward
		given a word stabilizer chain of the group, but I'm not at all certain if there exists
		something like that for a groupoid.
