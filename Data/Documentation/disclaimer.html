		Concerning the puzzles: As far as I'm aware,
		this program does not violate any copyright or patent laws protecting other puzzles,
		real or virtual, that may resemble those simulated by this software.
		If I am in error,
		please contact me, and I will happily make arrangements to change the program, or even
		remove it altogether.  Note that the only way this program could possibly infringe on a patent is in
		an intellectual way.  Clearly the mechanisms I'm using (algorithmic) are not the same as
		those had by real-world puzzles (mechanical.)
