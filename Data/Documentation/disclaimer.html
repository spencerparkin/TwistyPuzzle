		<h1>1. Disclaimer and Copyrights</h1>
		<p>
		The first matter of disclaim can be found in the LICENSE file that accompanies this software.
		In short, this program uses the MIT license.  See the LICENSE file for further details, or
		look it up online.  Notice that anyone, including the author, is given the right to sell the sofware.
		Don't feel bad if you happened to pay for your copy.
		First, it's dirt cheap as it isn't worth much of anything anyway.
		Second, those who want a free copy
		will likely have to obtain the source code and compile it themselves on their desired platform.
		And lastly, you can feel great about having stimulated the economy and helped a brother out!
		If that doesn't help, feel free to take your revenge by selling your own copies of the program.
		Just be sure to fix all my bugs before you do.

		The other matter is one of copyright.  This program only claims to simulate puzzles that,
		out of meer coincidense, resemble and operate the same as other puzzles, physical or virtual,
		that are protected under copyright and patent laws.  If it is not okay to use any of the names
		that I have assigned to the various types of puzzles that can be simulated by this software,
		you will please notify me, and I will happily make the necessary changes.
