		<h1>7. Additional Resources</h1>
		<p>
		Lastly, I wanted to place here a collection of links to internet resources on twisty puzzling to which I'm quite partial.
		</p>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpm2hok50tHldh63tc17lcA">RedKB</a> -- RedKB has a great You-Tube channel on twisty puzzling.  He's a super-smart guy, and his videos are well-made.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQklZa7fT4_WkaQ9A9lS1lg">Twisty Puzzling</a> -- This guy also does a great job on his videos.  I subscribe to his channel too.</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/">Jaap's Puzzle Page</a> -- Jaap appears to know more about twisty puzzling than anyone would ever want to know.</li>
			<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/crazytwistypuzzler/">Crazy Twisty Puzzler</a> -- Lastly, for what it's worth, I keep a bunch of notes here on solutions that I've come up with.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>That's all for now.  I'm sure there are a lot of other great resources.  I'll add more as I run into them.
		I tend to dislike any expert of his or her domain if they're arrogent about it, though; no matter how smart they are.
		That can throw some items off the list above.
