		<h1>4. Program Defects</h1>
		<p>
		Please report bugs you find in the program <a href="https://github.com/spencerparkin/TwistyPuzzle/issues">here</a>.  This program was particularly challenging to write and it's certainly not perfect.
		It seems to work reasonably well for the most part, but if you find a problem, please let me know.
		My thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to file a bug report.  I can't promise I'll
		be able to address every issue, but I will at least give it some serious thought.
		</p>
