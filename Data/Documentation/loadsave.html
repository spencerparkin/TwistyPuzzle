		<h1>3. Loading and Saving</h1>
		<p>
		If you come to find the program at all compelling, you'll surely have the desire at some
		point to save your work.  Use the "Save" menu option from the "Program"
		menu to do so.  This saves the puzzle out as an XML file.  Similarly, use the "Load"
		menu option from the "Program" menu to load a previously saved puzzle.
