		<h1>The Bagua</h1>
		<p>
		To-date, the Bagua has given me the most trouble.  It is a wonderfully difficult puzzle.
		It can become horribly bandaged, and one can go in circles trying to make any head-way.
		Here's what I did to solve this thing.
		</p>
		<h2>Step 1: Get it into semi-cube shape.</h2>
		<p>
		By this I mean that it is in cube shape, save the small bumps that are made by the
		short, rectangular, thin peices making up two parts an edge block.  The bandaging can be bad
		enough that it seems impossible to get anywhere.  All I can say is that with some trial
		and error, you can get to situations where the following becomes easier, and that is to use
		corner-orientation moves (with setup moves that are multiples of a 1/2 turn) until all corner
		pieces are in corner locations and all edge pieces are in edge locations.
		</p>
		<h2>Step 2: Get it into cube shape.</h2>
		<p>
		At this point, small bumps may protrude from the edge blocks in a way that is more or less
		bandaging.  In any case, you'll eventually be able to use the following sequence...
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>X = (1/2)Fi,(1/2)Bi,2U,(1/2)Fi,(1/2)Bi</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		...to create what I like to call "V-pairs".  These are the said protrusions, two on a single
		edge block, and both on the same side of that block.  Once you have 4 V-pairs in a single top layer,
		and poking out the sides of the cube (not the top), then you can easiliy collapse them down to 0 V-pairs
		by moving the 4 corners to the 4 edge locations, and vice-versa.  Of course, the number of V-pairs
		you have to get rid of may not be a multiple of 4.  Not really seeing how to eliminate a single V-pair,
		I could see how to create a new one from an existing one.  What I did is move half of one away
		using a classic edge permutation sequence, and then resolve the semi-cube shape.  (That's not terribly
		precise, but it's all I can remember at the moment.)  After working your way up to 4 V-pairs, you can
		eliminate them all as already stated, and all V-pairs are now gone.
		</p>
		<h2>Step 3: Solve half the tiny triangles.</h2>
		<p>
		There are 8 tiny triangles per face, but in this step, you only need to solve half of them.
		The half you solve are those that point along the dialgonals of the cube, not the horizontals or verticals.
		Further, you only need them positioned up to being on their correct face, or the opposite of their correct face.
		For example, get the 4 tiny white triangles and 4 tiny yellow triangles distributed between the white
		and yellow faces.  You'll return to these pieces later in step 5.
		</p>
		<h2>Step 4: Solve the edge blocks.</h2>
		<p>
		Solving the edge blocks is time-consuming and tedious, but with patience, you can easily get to the
		point where you have all but two of them solved.  You're just using the sequence X given above after
		positioning and orienting the edge blocks in preparation for that move.  Careful planning is required.
		To put a single edge block together, you have to build 3 different peices of it in 3 different locations,
		then bring them together with 2 applications of the sequence X.
		</p>
		<p>
		When it comes down to the
		last two edge blocks, the following sequence is helpful.
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>K = 3[X,Y,Xi,Yi]</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		Here, X is as already given, and Y is given by...
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>Y = Fi,L,D,Li,Di,Fi,D,2F</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		The sequence K will swap a pair of quadrilateral faces on each of two opposing edge blocks in the
		top layer, while also flipping the triangular pieces in the center of each edge block.  You may also
		want to use X,Y,Xi to get the thin rectangular peices solved.  I'm forgetting how to get the edge block
		center, triangular peices positioned properly at the moment, but I don't recall it being too hard.
		</p>
		<p>
		To tri-cycle 3 tiny triangular peices spread across a pair of opposing edge blocks in the top layer
		(there are 4 in total), use the following sequence...
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>Q = B,A,Y,Ai,Yi,Bi</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		...where A is given by...
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>A = (1/2)Fi,(1/2)Bi,L,3[F,U,Fi,Ui],Li,(1/2)B,(1/2)F</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		Lastly, the following sequence is the secret sauce of solving the last two edge blocks.
		Again, these need to be on opposite sides in a top layer.  Executing the sequence...
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>2[Q,X]</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		...will tri-cycle 3 quadrilateral faces while leaving the rest of the puzzle invariant!
		If you find that you need to swap a pair of such faces, then you can still use this sequence
		if you involve a third quadrilateral of the same color as one of the two you need to swap.
		</p>
		<h2>Step 5: Solve the remaining tiny triangles.</h2>
		<p>
		This is a trivial matter of solving an even number of pairs of such triangles on opposite
		sides of the cube by temporarily breaking 2 pairs of edge blocks in one solve, then fixing
		them in another solve.  If you need to solve an odd number of tiny triangle pairs, then
		on the last pair, simply swap two tiny triangles of the same color to break 2 pairs of edge
		blocks, then fix them while solving the last pair of tiny triangles.
		</p>
		<h2>Step 6: Solve as you would a 3x3x3.</h2>
		<p>
		At last, solve the 3x3x3.  I'm faily sure that it's not possible for a single edge
		to be flipped or for some other sort of problem to occur.  Bask in the glory of having
		solved this infernal puzzle!
