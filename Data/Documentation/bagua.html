		<h1>The Bagua</h1>
		<p>
		To-date, the Bagua has given me the most trouble.  It is a wonderfully difficult puzzle.
		It can become horribly bandaged, and one can go in circles trying to make any head-way.
		Here's what I did to solve this thing.
		</p>
		<h2>Step 1: Get it into semi-cube shape.</h2>
		<p>
		By this I mean that it is in cube shape, save the small bumps that are made by the
		short, rectangular, thin peices making up one or two parts of an edge block.  The bandaging can be bad
		enough that it seems impossible to get anywhere.  All I can say is that with some trial
		and error, you can get to situations where the following becomes easier, and that is to use
		corner-permutation moves (with setup moves that are multiples of a 1/2 turn) until all corner
		pieces are in corner locations and all edge pieces are in edge locations.  To help reduce bandaging
		in preparation for such moves, try to get into a state where you can execute the well known sequence...
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>2[Ri,Di,R,D]</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		...and its variants to re-orient the center bits of the edge blocks.  Getting these "flaps" to lay
		down flat against the cube will significantly minimize bandaging.  I refer to this as "flattening" later on.
		Many useful sequence will require you to subsequently resolve some edge and corner peices, then reflatten a few edge block
		center bits.  The well-known corner tri-cycle I use is...
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>U,R,Ui,Li,U,Ri,Ui,L</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		...which usually needs to be setup with a half turn in order to interchange corner pieces and center bits of edge blocks.
		</p>
		<h2>Step 2: Get it into cube shape and solve half the tiny triangles.</h2>
		<p>
		At this point, small bumps may protrude from the edge blocks in a way that is more or less
		bandaging, but the general shape of the puzzle is more cube-shaped than ever before.  In any case,
		you'll eventually be able to use the following sequence...
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>X = (1/2)Fi,(1/2)Bi,2U,(1/2)F,(1/2)B</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		...to create what I like to call "V-pairs".  These are the said protrusions, two on a single
		edge block, and both on the same side of that block.  Once you have 4 V-pairs in a single top layer,
		and poking out the sides of the cube (not the top), then you can easiliy collapse them down to 0 V-pairs
		by moving the 4 corners to the 4 edge locations, and vice-versa.  Swapping a pair of corners and edges
		can be accomplished with...
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>F,3[R,U,Ri,Ui],Fi,(1/2)R,F,3[R,U,Ri,Ui],Fi,(1/2)Ri</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		...so two applications of this in the right contexts (from the right perspectives) will reduce the 4 V-pairs down to zero.
		</p>
		Of course, the number of V-pairs
		you have to get rid of may not be a multiple of 4.  Not really seeing how to eliminate a single V-pair,
		I could see how to create a new V-pair.  (Reverse this idea, I suppose, to eliminate V-pairs one by one.)
		Once you work your way up to 4 again, you can collapse them back down to 0 as already prescribed.
		The basic move is as follows...
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>(1/2)Di,M,2U,Mi,(1/2)D</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		This puts you back at step 1, but you're just a single tri-cycle and a flattening away from being back in semi-cube shape;
		and furthermore, you've created one V-pair and two edge blocks that can be combine to form another new V-pair.
		If you only wanted to create 1 V-pair in total, then you do the above sequence involving an edge block
		that is a half-V-block, instead of a non-V-block (i.e., a solved edge block in terms of shape only, not color.)
		</p>
		<p>
		With what's been said thus far, we can go from semi-cube shape to cube shape; problem is, however, that we have
		to combine this step with the problem of getting half the tiny triangles solved in the corner positions, at least
		up to being positioned on their correct or opposite faces.  Think about the process that takes 4 V-pairs to 0 V-pairs.
		It will effectively swap 4 of the 8 tiny triangles on a face with the other 4.  Of course, we can do this on any face
		for which we have yet to resolve the triangles we care about.  On the last face, we can avoid the problem by breaking
		the V-pairs (using the sequence X above) and then resolving them (again using X) in such a way that the vertex of the "V"
		in the V-pair contains a tiny triangle of the desired color.  This lets you kill the last 4 V-pairs without destroying the
		work you've done to solve the 4 tiny triangles that live in the 4 corners of the face.
		</p>
		<p>
		So the last thing to describe here is how we can move the tiny triangles around.  What I've done is use...
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>(1/2)R,2U,F,3[R,U,Ri,Ui],Fi,(1/2)Ri,(1/2)L,U,B,Ui,Fi,U,Bi,Ui,(1/2)Li</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		...after setting up for the move so that a tiny triangle from an edge lands where I want it to land in a corner.
		This sequence will bring you back to step 1, but you're only one flattening away from getting back to step 2
		with some additional progress made.  Note that this also creates V-pairs, so it's give and take between the
		problem of solving the tiny corner triangles and eliminating the V-pairs.
		</p>
		<p>
		The following is also useful.
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>(1/2)B,(1/2)L,(1/2)R,R,U,Ri,U,R,2U,Ri,(1/2)Li,(1/2)Ri,(1/2)Bi</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		The sequence 7P is also useful, where...
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>P = 2R,U,2R,Ui</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		This tri-cycles tiny triangles while eliminating a single V-pair.
		</p>
		<h2>Step 3: Solve the edge blocks.</h2>
		<p>
		The cube now being back in perfect cube shape, we turn our attention to solving the colors of the edge blocks.
		Doing so is time-consuming and tedious, but with patience, you can easily get to the
		point where you have all but two of them solved.  You're just using the sequence X given above after
		positioning and orienting the edge blocks in preparation for that move.  Careful planning is required.
		To put a single edge block together, you have to build 3 different peices of it in 3 different locations,
		then bring them together with 2 applications of the sequence X.  As you go about this, and throughout this
		entire step, you need not worry about the tiny corner triangles you solved in the last step, as long as
		you stick to the sequence X (from any perspective.)  We will easily
		address these tiny corner triangles for the last time in step 4.  You do, however, need to make sure that
		you don't break a solved edge block while solving a new one;
		or at least, that you only temporarily break any existing edge blocks while solving a new one.
		</p>
		<p>
		The crux of this step occurs when we come down to solving the
		last two edge blocks.  The following sequence is helpful.
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>K = 3[X,Y,Xi,Yi]</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		Here, X is as already given, and Y is given by...
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>Y = Fi,L,D,Li,Di,Fi,D,2F</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		The sequence K will swap a pair of quadrilateral faces on each of two opposing edge blocks in the
		top layer, while also flipping the triangular pieces in the center of each edge block.  You may also
		want to use X,Y,Xi to get the thin rectangular peices solved.  Replace X in K with Xi to do a varient of the move that is mirror image.
		</p>
		<p>
		To tri-cycle 3 tiny triangular peices spread across a pair of opposing edge blocks in the top layer
		(there are 4 in total), use the following sequence...
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>Q = B,A,Y,Ai,Yi,Bi</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		...where A is given by...
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>A = (1/2)Fi,(1/2)Bi,L,3[F,U,Fi,Ui],Li,(1/2)B,(1/2)F</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		To avoid unsolvability of these tiny triangles by tri-cycling, make sure the last two edge blocks
		share a common color.
		</p>
		<p>
		Lastly, the following sequence is the secret sauce of solving the last two edge blocks.
		Again, these need to be on opposite sides in a top layer.  Executing the sequence...
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>2[Q,X]</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		...will tri-cycle 3 quadrilateral faces while leaving the rest of the puzzle invariant!
		If you find that you need to swap a pair of such faces, then you can still use this sequence
		if you involve a third quadrilateral of the same color as one of the two you need to swap.
		Replace X with Xi to do a varient of the tri-cycle that is mirror image.  (It's possible that
		the A in Q can be replaced with something like something like...
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>(1/2)U,L,R,2D,Ri,Li,(1/2)Ui</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		...a sequence a friend of mine told me about that is quite convenient.)
		</p>
		<p>
		Following is a picture of the tri-cycle with X in the sequence.

		</p>
		<p>
		Following is a picture of the tri-cycle with Xi in the sequence.
		<center><img src="BaguaTriCycleB.jpg"/></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		Note that all algorithms given thus far for solving the last two composite edge blocks will
		not be enough if you are experiencing a parity problem of the puzzle that manifests itself
		as the solver being unable to get the edge centers oriented and positioned with respect to the edge sliver peices.
		From what I've heard from a friend, rotating one face 45 degrees, then resolving shape is a way
		of dealing with the error.  Knowing if you have the parity issue might be possible by looking
		at the orientation of the centers.  In any case, I believe that the following
		sequence toggles the parity.  (It has worked for me every time so far.)
		</p>
		<p>
		<center><code>(1/2)Ui,W,(1/2)U,W,(3/2)U,W,(1/2)U,W,(3/2)U,W,2U,4[7T,U],Ui</code></center>
		</p>
		...where...
		<p>
		<center><code>W = R,3[U,F,Ui,Fi],Ri</code></center>
		</p>
		...and...
		<p>
		<center><code>T = 2L,D,2L,Di</code></center>
		</p>
		<p>
		Without needing to memorize any of this, the idea is simply to do the 45 degree rotation
		of the top, then swap corners with edge-centers, then kill the V-pairs as usual.
		I wish I understood the exact nature of the parity, and must admit to not really being able
		to take any credit whatsoever in coming up with a solution to it.  Yes, the sequence above is mine,
		but it is a direct consequence of following 3rd-hand advice from somewhere on the internet.
		So yes, I used help on this last peice of the puzzle.  Oh well.  At least I can see now that
		I know of a full solution to this puzzle, even if I didn't fully find it myself.
		</p>
		<h2>Step 4: Solve the remaining tiny triangles.</h2>
		<p>
		This is a trivial matter of solving an even number of pairs of such triangles on opposite
		sides of the cube by temporarily breaking 2 pairs of edge blocks in one solve, then fixing
		them in another solve.  If you need to solve an odd number of tiny triangle pairs, then
		on the last pair, simply swap two tiny triangles of the same color to break 2 pairs of edge
		blocks, then fix them while solving the last pair of tiny triangles.
		Of coures, these breaks and fixes are accomplished with the sequence X with preparation
		between applications.
		</p>
		<h2>Step 5: Solve as you would a 3x3x3.</h2>
		<p>
		At last, solve the 3x3x3.  I'm fairly sure that it's not possible for a single edge
		to be flipped or for some other sort of problem to occur.  Bask in the glory of having
		solved this infernal puzzle!
