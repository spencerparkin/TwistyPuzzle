		<p>
		Following are links to You-Tube videos I've made where I demonstrate how to solve some of the puzzles using this software.
		These aren't meant to help you learn how to solve twisty puzzles; rather, they are meant to help
		you quickly become acquainted with using the software.  If you want to avoid spoilers, just read the text-based
		documentation.

		As of this writing, I don't have many videos uploaded.  Please forgive my poor public speaking skills.
